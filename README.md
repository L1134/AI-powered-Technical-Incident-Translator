# 🚨 NOC Incident Interpreter — AI Assisted Triage

Telecom environments generate high volumes of technical incidents that require fast interpretation, categorization and dispatch decisions.  
This prototype explores the use of AI for **assistive triage** in NOC (Network Operations Center) environments.

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

Reduce cognitive load and reaction time in operational environments by transforming raw technical incident descriptions into structured insights that support NOC decisions.

---

## 🗂 **Key Capabilities**

✔ Converts raw incident text into operational language  
✔ Highlights estimated severity  
✔ Identifies relevant service domain (ex: GPON, Backbone, IP, RF, Energy, Field, Core, etc.)  
✔ Suggests dispatch decision (optional)  
✔ Offers human-readable explanation for non-technical stakeholders  
✔ Displays indicators relevant to network operations  

> This prototype is **assistive**, not deterministic. Human validation remains in the decision loop.

---

## 🎛 **Target Operational Contexts**

The tool is designed for:

- Internet Service Providers (ISP)
- Mobile & Carrier NOCs
- Enterprise NOCs (Retail, Banking, Industry)
- Datacenter & Hosting environments
- Field operations & Dispatch centers

Reduce cognitive load and reaction time in operational environments by transforming raw technical incident descriptions into structured insights that support NOC decisions.

## 🧠 **Why this Matters**

NOC teams often deal with:

- fragmented data streams
- heterogeneous vendor terminology
- complex infrastructure layers
- multi-domain troubleshooting
- high operational pressure

AI can **translate**, **structure** and **reduce interpretation time**, improving:

✔ MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)  
✔ MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)  
✔ internal communication quality  
✔ operational situational awareness

## 🚀 **Project Stage**

This repository is in **R&D / Prototype** phase and serves as a functional demonstration of:

- AI-assisted triage workflows
- Multi-domain incident classification
- Human-in-the-loop assisted operations

Future roadmap includes:

📌 domain fine-tuning  
📌 multi-vendor glossaries  
📌 structured integration outputs (ex: NMS, OSS, ITSM)  
📌 dispatch automation assistance  
📌 analytics dashboards  
📌 enriched datasets

## 📍 **Intellectual Property Notice**

Due to the strategic operational nature of the project, internal logic, methodology, model prompts, mappings, and inference processes are **not publicly exposed** in this repository.

This prototype demonstrates **outcomes**, not implementation.
